You can read an in-depth description of this project here    .

#### How this project works:
Whenever a push occurs to the Main branch, it activates the GitHub actions I've set up, enabling them to:

* Execute 'terraform init' to initialize Terraform
* Apply Terraform changes automatically with auto-approval
* Sync website files (HTML & CSS) to S3



to put my understanding of Terraform, i will configure and provision all the infrastructures with it.
